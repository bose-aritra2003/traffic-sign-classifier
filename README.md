# Traffic Sign Classifier

## Overview
- **Real-time Traffic Symbol Prediction:** Developed an advanced computer vision application leveraging Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for real-time traffic symbol recognition.
- **LeNet-5 CNN Architecture:** Implemented the LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network architecture to effectively classify various traffic symbols, resulting in improved prediction accuracy at lower computational cost.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Skillfully utilized OpenCV for image preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.
